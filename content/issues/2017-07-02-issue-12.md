Happy Sunday everyone! More ransomeware fallout from Petya this week, along with some milestones for Let's Encrypt.

Talking about milestones, [Job Snijders on twitter](https://twitter.com/JobSnijders/status/878282231940345856) managed to make a [Nyancat using BGP](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/routing-history#w.resource=as15562&w.starttime=2017-01-15T00%3A00%3A00&w.endtime=2017-06-23T00%3A00%3A00&show=Maxmized). Frigging awesome.
