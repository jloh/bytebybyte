It has been a pretty busy week personally so this edition is a bit late, sorry about that! I've got some old and new articles this week and I'm also working on a JavaScript free design for [our website](https://www.thisweekin.technology/) that should launch next week.

### [Stack Overflow: The Architecture - 2016](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/)  
Bit of an old article but still great. This three part series goes into Stack Overflows architecture from the technology stack to the physical (not cloud!) hardware that powers it.

### [Tales of SugarCRM Security Horrors](http://karmainsecurity.com/tales-of-sugarcrm-security-horrors)  
For those that don't know, SugarCRM is a [Customer Relationship Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) tool. Turns out that the free edition is not nearly as secure as I'm sure many people had hoped.

### [Cybersecurity firm exposed non-anonymized hospital data in demos](https://www.scmagazine.com/security-firm-in-hot-water-after-exposing-hospital-data-in-demos/article/651757/)  
In security news this week a California hospital has non-anonymized network data exposed due to a live demo by one of their vendors.

### [FlexiSpy hack Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/9zbia1HB)  
FlexiSpy shutdown their whole network earlier this week which prompted the release of this pastebin. For those that don't know, FlexiSpy is a pretty shady company dealing with remote spying/monitoring tools.

### [How SHH got port 22](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port)  
This is a pretty short read on how port 22 ended up being SSH with a few guides on allowing it through `iptables`.

I struggled to find articles this week sadly so some of the content might be sub-par. If you'd like to get involved with next week and submit some articles checkout our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jloh/thisweekintechnology/issues/) on GitHub.

P.S: for those of you on HipChat make sure you've [read this article](https://blog.hipchat.com/2017/04/24/hipchat-security-notice/) about their security breach!
