### [Mandatory ISP data retention](https://www.troyhunt.com/mandatory-isp-data-retention-and-the-law-of-unintended-consequences/)  
This is quite a long post by Troy Hunt covering the increasing issue of metadata retention by ISPs and the effect it is happening.

### [Phishing with Unicode Domains](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/)  
It looks like this has now been patched in the newest version of Google Chrome (So update!) but this technique of using Unicode domains could've been pretty big.

### [Intel's New SSD](http://bgr.com/2017/03/20/intel-optane-3d-xpoint-ssd/)  
10 years in the making, Intel are releasing a new SSD that is rumored to be five-to-eight times faster than NAND SSDs. Unfortunately its unlikely to be available in any commercial products this year.

### [Intel Pulls Out of OpenStack Effort](http://fortune.com/2017/04/14/intel-openstack-project-rackspace/)  
This is a sad time for OpenStack as Intel pulls out of a joint effort it made with Rackspace. This isn't the first time this has happened recently either with Cisco and HPE both shifting their focus to other areas.

### [Abusing NVIDIA's node.js to bypass application whitelisting](http://blog.sec-consult.com/2017/04/application-whitelisting-application.html)  
The final post for this week is a sad day for anyone with an NVIDIA graphics card. Hope you enjoy running Node.js on your system!
