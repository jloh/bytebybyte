Lots of news this week on a wide range of topics! I've started putting ⭐'s to my favourite article of the week, let me know what you think.

### Tool of the week - [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) <i class="fa fa-github"></i>  
Zappa is a python framework around AWS' API/lambda features allowing you to deploy serverless APIs. I just moved my personal API written in flask to it and it was a breeze!

### [AWS Security Primer](https://cloudonaut.io/aws-security-primer/) ⭐

[Seriously, these things are so small](https://scontent.fsyd3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12809198_1699872030290917_2018254014_n.png?oh=42cb295832bf717e20f9ba29e896ae2d&oe=59D2BD8E).
